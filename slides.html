# 🗂️ Safe concurrency

Ensuring that code **keeps working** (maybe in degraded mode) in the face of problems

--

It gets harder as systems grow:

- Concurrent workers
- Shared resources

--

Arrow provides **high-level** tools for this

---

# 🧬 Coroutines

Coroutines are **suspendable** computations

- Built in the Kotlin language

--

.code70[
```kotlin
interface UserRepository {
  // coroutines are marked with 'suspend'
  suspend fun getByName(name: String): User?
  suspend fun User.friends(): List<UserId>
}
```
]

---

# 🧬 Coroutines and concurrency

Coroutines are used as a basis for **concurrency**

- Suspendable computations are _scheduled_
- Co-operative lightweight multi-tasking

> This is why `kotlinx.coroutines` is a library

---

# 🧬 Coroutines and concurrency

Operations for concurrent actions live in `CoroutineScope` (or extend it)

.code60[
```kotlin
fun <T> CoroutineScope.async(
  context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext,
  start: CoroutineStart = CoroutineStart.DEFAULT,
  block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> T
): Deferred<T>
```
]

No mention of coroutines contexts today

---

# 🏁 Finish modes for coroutines

✅ .grey[**Success**]

⚡ **Exception**

- Problem makes it impossible to complete

❌ **Cancellation**

- Some job is no longer needed
- Implemented via `CancellationException`

---

# 🏁 Finish modes for coroutines

✅ .grey[**Success**] &nbsp; ⚡ **Exception** &nbsp; ❌ **Cancellation**

We want to launch two jobs and <br /> wait only for the first one to finish

- If one succeeds or throws an exception <br /> ⟹ the other should be cancelled
- If the calling computation is cancelled <br /> ⟹ both jobs should be cancelled
- What happens if both throw an exception?
- Or that exception is thrown while cancelling?
- ...

# 🏳️ Introducing Arrow Fx

High-level functions for easier concurrency

.code60[
```kotlin
suspend fun UserRepo.getUserInfo(name: String): UserInfo? 
  = getByName(name)?.let { user ->
      parZip(
        { download(user.avatarUrl) },
        { user.friends().parMap { getById(it).name } }
      ) { avatar, friendNames -> 
            UserInfo(user.id, name, avatar, friendNames) 
      }
    }
```
]

---

# 🏳️ Introducing Arrow Fx

High-level functions for easier concurrency

.code60[
```kotlin
suspend fun UserRepo.getUserInfo(name: String): UserInfo? 
  = nullable {
      val user = getByName(name).bind()
      parZip(
        { download(user.avatarUrl) },
        { user.friends().parMap { getById(it).name } }
      ) { avatar, friendNames -> 
            UserInfo(name, avatar, friendNames) 
      }
    }
```
]

Even nicer with Arrow's typed errors! 🤩

---

# ⚡ Errors vs. exceptions

_Isn't Arrow all about Functional Programming?_ <br />
_And don't you all hate exceptions?_

--

Exceptions are for **exceptional** cases

- Outside of the regular operation
- Resolution depends on some third party

--

Exceptions are **not** for _domain_ errors

- Validation errors
- User cannot be found in the database

---

# ⛓️ Service is (temporarily) down

You cannot contact some other service

- Network connection is lost <br /> (happens quite often in mobile)
- Microservice is being updated

But you expect it to be back soon(ish)

> Bring Arrow Resilience in!

---

# ↩️ Retries

The simplest resilience pattern is just **try again**

.code70[
```kotlin
suspend fun download(url: Url): ByteArray =
  Schedule.recurs(5).retry {
    url.readBytes()
  }
```
]

--

- `Schedule` describes the policy
  - Try at most 5 times, or throw
- `retry` uses that policy to perform the action

---

# 🧮 More complex policies

.margin-top[
- **Constant** delay between attempts
- **Increased** delay between attempts
  - Linear backoff
  - Exponential backoff
- **Jittering** adds random noise to the delay
- **Conditions** to stop or continue
]

Check `Schedule`'s companion object

---

# 😵‍💫 Overloads

Imagine the following scenario:

- Clients talk to a server each 1 s. on average
  - They implement a retry strategy
- Server goes down for 5 minutes

--

Server is flooded with 300 requests at once!

---

# 🪢 Circuit breaker

<img src="img/circuitbreaker.png" width="100%" />

In _Open_ state all requests fail (quickly)

In _Half Open_ only the **test** request is allowed

- If successful, back to _Closed_ state

---

# 🪢 Circuit breaker

.code70[
```kotlin
// 1️⃣ define the strategy
val circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker(
  openingStrategy = OpeningStrategy.Count(2),
  resetTimeout = 2.seconds,
  exponentialBackoffFactor = 1.2,
  maxResetTimeout = 60.seconds,
)

// 2️⃣ protect the computation
circuitBreaker.protectOrThrow {
  url.download()
}
```
]

# 🦾 More resilience patterns

[_Cloud Design Patterns_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/)
(in Azure Docs) <br /> contains a great repository of patterns

- Bulkhead
- Rate limiter
- ...

Libraries like Resilience4j implement many

# 🦾 More resilience patterns

Libraries like Resilience4j implement many

_Why use Arrow Resilience then?_

--

1️⃣ Arrow is a Multiplatform (KMP) library

- Native, iOS, JS, in addition to JVM

2️⃣ Arrow provides idiomatic APIs

- Integration with the coroutine system

---

# 🧰 Resource management

Many external services require _preparation_

- Create and manage a connection
- Dispose resources in an ordered manner
- Share a common pool between workers

--

## Basic solutions in Kotlin

.margin-top[
- `try`/`catch`/`finally` (inherited from Java)
- `resource.use { ... }`
]

---

# 🧰 Resource management

.margin-top[
- `try`/`catch`/`finally` (inherited from Java)
- `resource.use { ... }`
]

## Problems

.margin-top[
- Deep nesting instead of linear code
- Release is defined far from acquisition
  - Either in `finally` for `try`,
  - Or in the `close` implementation
]

---

# Concurrency 🤝 resources

**Structured** concurrency / resource mgmt.

Scopes indicate computations start and end

- Scope nesting replicates parent/child jobs
- Parent awaits (and supervises) children

---

# 🧱 Structured concurrency

Entry point to "get" a `CoroutineScope`

.code70[
```kotlin
suspend fun <R> coroutineScope(
  block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> R
): R
```
]

Concurrency operations live in that class

.code70[
```kotlin
//        ↱ the parent scope
fun <T> CoroutineScope.async(...): Deferred<T>
fun     CoroutineScope.cancel(...)
```
]

---

# 🎣 Defining a resource

.code60[
```kotlin
resourceScope {
  // using custom acquire/release
  val config = install({ CONFIG_FILE.inputStream() })
                       { f, _ -> f.close() }

  // using integration with AutoCloseable
  val client = autoCloseable { HttpClient() }

  // function with ResourceScope as receiver
  val db = DbConnectionFactory.get()

  // and now work with config, client, and db!
}
```
]

--

🪹 No nesting &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 🧩 Composable

---

# 🧱 Structured resource management

The scope defines when resources are released

.code70[
```kotlin
resourceScope { }
```
]

Function with `ResourceScope` as receiver define acquisition and release of resources

.code70[
```kotlin
fun ResourceScope.webClient(): HttpClient
```
]

---

# Resources 🤝 concurrency

Let's acquire the resources _in parallel_

.code60[
```kotlin
resourceScope {
  val (config, httpClient, db) = parZip(
    { autoCloseable { CONFIG_FILE.inputStream() } },
    { autoCloseable { HttpClient() } },
    { DbConnectionFactory.get() }
  ) { file, client, db ->
    Module(config, httpClient, db)
  }
  // and now work with config, client, and db!
}
```
]

--

Try writing this without these abstractions 🤯

---

# 🏠 SuspendApp

Extends `Resource` with _graceful shutdown_

- Ensures all finalizers are run even when `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` happen
- Gives enough time for ordered exit

Useful when scaling or replacing applications

---

# 🏠 SuspendApp

For CLI applications, just wrap the `main`

.code70[
```kotlin
suspend fun main() = SuspendApp {
  resourceScope {
    val (config, httpClient, db) = ...
    // and now work with config, client, and db!
    ...
  }
}
```
]

Integration with Ktor is also available

---

# 🕸️ Distributed transactions

Sequence of steps that succeed or fail as a unit

- If they fail, we must roll back to the start
- Those steps happen in _different machines_

--

## Saga pattern

.margin-top[
- Define for each step a _compensating action_ that "undoes" that action
- When a step fails, run the compensating actions in reverse order
]

---

# Resources ⚔️ sagas

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Resources</th>
    <th>Sagas</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 10px;"><i>For each action we define...</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finalizer</td>
    <td>Compensating action</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 10px;"><i>On success</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Run finalizers</td>
    <td>Do nothing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 10px;"><i>On failure</i></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp; Run finalizers</td>
    <td>Run compensating actions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

# 🧱 Structured sagas

.code70[
```kotlin
saga {    // introduces the SagaScope

  saga({  // defines a single step
    Counter.increment()
  }) {    // alongside its compensation
    Counter.decrement()
  }

  // each step is wrapped with 'saga'
  saga({ url.download(PATH) }) { PATH.delete() }
  ...
}
```
]

---

# 🎭 Conclusion

0️⃣ Coroutines form a great substrate for managing computations

--

1️⃣ Separate description from execution

- `Schedule`, `CircuitBreaker`, and other policies

--

2️⃣ Structure and scopes make our life easier

- Runner that introduces `ThingScope`
- Operations live in that `ThingScope`
